DESCRIPTION: 
(Murphy, Q.M. et al, Mathematical Biosciences. (2024))
Power-law model (Equation 4) used for antibody decay in patients following mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. 
We fit two parameters: alpha and k. 
The only output is log10_A, log10-transformed antibody endpoint titers following vaccination.
Monolix version 2023R1.

Variables
-log10_A is the log10-transformed antibody endpoint titers days post vaccination
- t is time, where log10(t)-log10(28)

Parameters
- alpha is log10 transformed antibodies at day t=28 
- k is the antibody decay rate, where k>0 

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {alpha,k} ; List of parameters used for fitting

EQUATION:
; Equation for fitting

log10_A = alpha - (k)*(t)  ; Power-law Model: log10-transformed antibody endpoint titers post vaccination

OUTPUT:
output = {log10_A} ; model output that is fitted against 'OBSERVATION' in the 'Data file' tab
